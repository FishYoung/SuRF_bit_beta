# Succinct Range Filter (SuRF)

> **SuRF** is a fast and compact filter that provides exact-match filtering,
range filtering, and approximate range counts. This is the source code for our
[SIGMOD best paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~huanche1/publications/surf_paper.pdf).
We also host a [demo website](https://www.rangefilter.io/).
The RocksDB experiments with SuRF can be found [here](https://github.com/efficient/rocksdb).

And this is a ve.................................ry simple implement of Succinct Range Filter.... in JAVA.

Why java??

Humm... it's a long and disappointing story...

Anyway, I will try c++ again in some day. (if wo neng chong xin ru men c++. Or, abandon?)


Not exactly same implement with [Efficient/SuRF](https://github.com/efficient/SuRF). Some of the algorithm has not been impletmented yet.
